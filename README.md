# Pneumatics


Herein is described the pneumatic control system used in the HATTONLAB to control pneumatic smart surfaces.

Overview

This system is designed to control pneumatic smart surfaces, using only small amounts of air.


The system is designed to provide fast switching, multiple channels.



Pneumatic Control.

The Pneumatic logic is as follows:

Two pumps (one for positive and one for negative pressure) are attached to two resevoirs. The resevoirs can be pumped to reach the desired pressure and held.



Valves
on the inlet side, there are three valves.
The valves control the inlet flow.

3 valves
1 to allow positive pressure
1 to allow negative pressure
1 to exhuast

Outlet:

On the outlet side, valves can be turned on to pressurize the channels.
